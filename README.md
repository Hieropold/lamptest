LampTest
=========

A PhoneGap-based mobile application for scanning lamp barcode and getting useful information about that particular product, e.g. real measured luminosity, power consumption, etc.

It uses [LampTest](http://lamptest.ru) site as a data source.

Build
-----

```
npm install
bower install
gulp
```

Application building process depends on build.phonegap.com service, so existing build.phonegap.com service account is required.

TODO
----
* Add support for other lamp types (CFL and incandescent, see 0043168179386 and 4895041412655)
* Bug: not possible to press Scan again after lamp was not found
* Add filter by base type (E14, E27)
* Add tooltips for all parameters (some info about the meaning of lamp parameter)
* Add lamp rating to the list, near the lamp title.
* Update lamps dynamically.
* Sometimes the lamp is marked as obsolete although it was previously displayed as active, e.g.: X-Flash 42968, 42975
* Multiple lamps with the same barcode
* New params - weight, CQS, minimum voltage, driver type, max case temperature.
